This is the "create-react-app" version of start_server. (I'm on my way to make more).

This command is made to make it easier starting the npm server.

Copy the File start_server.bat to C:/Windows/system32 (or simply start the Installer.bat it makes the same, but faster^^) to make start_server work everywhere around Windows in Command Prompt.

Enter the Command: start_server to direct to the bat,

and then as a Parameter enter the Directory of your Project.

For Example: start_server C:/Projects/ToDoList.
